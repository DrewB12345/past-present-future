<img class="right" src="images/greenville.png" alt="Greenville, South Carolina">
<p>I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina">Greenville, South Carolina</a>. In the past, I have only lived in two different houses, both being in Greenville, and I moved out of the first one when I was only a few months old. As I grew up, I lived with three siblings, my mother, and my stepfather.</p>
<h3>Five things that happened in my past</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I took a trip to Disney World.</li>
  <li>I went to Philadelphia</li>
  <li>I visited Washington, D.C.</li>
  <li>I went to New York</li>

<h2>My Present</h2>
<img class="left" src="images/picture_of_me.png" alt="A picture of me">
<p>I am still living in Greenville, South Carolina today, and I also live in the same house as before. I still live with my mother, my stepfather, and one sibling. Just like in the past, my main hobby remains to be playing video games. However, after discovering the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> app a few years ago, I also watch a lot of videos in my spare time.</p>

<p>I am currently in my third year of highschool, and will graduate in 2018. I have an A in most of my classes, and I am taking multiple Honors level classes and an AP class. Although I'm not the best at writing essays in English, I do great in math classes. I'm a hard worker at school, and I will continue to be a hard worker.</p>
